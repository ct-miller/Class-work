#Many companies use telephone numbers like 555-GET-FOOD so the number is easier for their customers to remember.
# On a standard telephone, the alphabetic letters are mapped to numbers in the following fashion:

#A, B, and C      = 2
#D, E, and F      = 3
#G, H, and I        = 4
#J, K, and L       = 5
#M, N, and O     = 6
#P, Q, R, and S = 7
#T, U, and V      = 8
#W, X, Y, and Z = 9
#Write a program that asks the user to enter a 10-character telephone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.
# The application should display the telephone number with any alphabetic characters that
# appeared in the original translated to their numeric equivalent.
#For example, if the user enters 555-GET-FOOD the application should display 555-438-3663.
