#Write a class named Car that has the following data attributes:
#• __year_model (for the car’s year model)
#• __make (for the make of the car)
#• __speed (for the car’s current speed)

#The Car class should have an __init__ method that accept the car’s year model and make as arguments.
# These values should be assigned to the object’s __year_model and __make data attributes.
# It should also assign 0 to the __speed data attribute.
#The class should also have the following methods:
#• accelerate
#The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it is called.
#• brake
#The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
#• get_speed
#The get_speed method should return the current speed.
#Next, design a program that creates a Car object, and then calls the accelerate method five times.
# After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
# Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the brake method,
# get the current speed of the car and display it.
